# AndroidRunner
Android app that tracks distance for use in sessional runs

See [Documentation.pdf](Documentation.pdf) for app information.

### Project Aim
The aim of this project is to design and develop a simple running tracker. An android application that
can be used to track and store data on runs or other movement you do.
I have chosen to focus my application on the idea of activity sessions, when the user wishes to take a
run of a specific length and record their timings and speed for each attempt. This would be useful for
anyone that frequently takes runs of the same length or time. Therefore, my application has two
states of data recording: in-session and non-session. The user must explicitly start and stop a
“session” to record the session data.
